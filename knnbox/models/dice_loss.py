class DiceLoss(nn.Module):
    """
    Dice coefficient for short, is an F1-oriented statistic used to gauge the similarity of two sets.
    Given two sets A and B, the vanilla dice coefficient between them is given as follows:
        Dice(A, B)  = 2 * True_Positive / (2 * True_Positive + False_Positive + False_Negative)
                    = 2 * |A and B| / (|A| + |B|)

    Math Function:
        U-NET: https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597.pdf
        dice_loss(p, y) = 1 - numerator / denominator
            numerator = 2 * \sum_{1}^{t} p_i * y_i + smooth
            denominator = \sum_{1}^{t} p_i + \sum_{1} ^{t} y_i + smooth
        if square_denominator is True, the denominator is \sum_{1}^{t} (p_i ** 2) + \sum_{1} ^{t} (y_i ** 2) + smooth
        V-NET: https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04797.pdf
    Args:
        smooth (float, optional): a manual smooth value for numerator and denominator.
        square_denominator (bool, optional): [True, False], specifies whether to square the denominator in the loss function.
        with_logits (bool, optional): [True, False], specifies whether the input tensor is normalized by Sigmoid/Softmax funcs.
        ohem_ratio: max ratio of positive/negative, defautls to 0.0, which means no ohem.
        alpha: dsc alpha
    Shape:
        - input: (*)
        - target: (*)
        - mask: (*) 0,1 mask for the input sequence.
        - Output: Scalar loss
    Examples:
        >>> loss = DiceLoss(with_logits=True, ohem_ratio=0.1)
        >>> input = torch.FloatTensor([2, 1, 2, 2, 1])
        >>> input.requires_grad=True
        >>> target = torch.LongTensor([0, 1, 0, 0, 0])
        >>> output = loss(input, target)
